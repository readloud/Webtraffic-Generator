# Sample Data

## surge-out

This folder contains output files generated by SURGE <span id="a1">[[1]](#f1)</span>.

## locustfile.py

A sample `locust` definition file generated by `wtg-seal`. To manually create
this file based on the sample files at [surge-out](surge-out), run:

```shell
wtgseal --csv-stats-interval 5 --group-by-doc objout.txt name.txt
```

## www.tar.gz

This file expands to a folder containing the files generated in the last stage
of SURGE, which should be placed at a web server.

Once the files are hosted, you can run `locust` to generate web traffic, using
[locustfile.py](locustfile.py) as input.
